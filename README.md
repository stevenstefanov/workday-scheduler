# workday-scheduler

## What is the project?

This project is a workday scheduler. A user can see the current date and time, enter tasks and save them for future use and can see whether a task is in the past, present or future.

## What were the challenges?

My biggest challenge was traversing the DOM to go from the save button to the textarea to save it to local storage. 

## Why did I decide to do this project?

This project was really interesting to develop. It is a very practical application as I constantly use my calendar to keep track of appointments and meetings. It was also really beneficial to explore the moment() library and how to best utilize it.

## What I learned in the process?

I learned a lot more about computer logic and flow of code. I learned more about the moment() library and DOM traversing.

## What makes this project stand out?

This project is a great example of simple yet very effective workday scheduler.

## Instalation

No instalation required on this project. Simply run as a normal website.

## Usage

This is a single page website. Upon start, user is presented with the current date and time on top and a daily planner with the hours of 8am - 5pm. The user can enter text in the middle fields and press the save button. Upon pressing the save button, any text entered in the corresponding text field on the same row gets saved to the local storage. If a field is colored in gray, the events are in the past; if the field is red, it is the present, and if it is green, it is in the future.
